Simply type `bundle-deps` in your project\nroot to update your `bundledDependencies` list based on the package.json\n`dependencies` hash.\n\n### Install\n\n```\n$ (sudo) npm install -g bundle-deps\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```\n$ bundle-deps [path/to/project]\nbundled 48 dependencies.\n```\n\n- - -\n\n### Developed by [Terra Eclipse](http://www.terraeclipse.com)\nTerra Eclipse, Inc. is a nationally recognized political technology and\nstrategy firm located in Aptos, CA and Washington, D.C.\n\n- - -\n\n### License: MIT\n\n- Copyright (C) 2012 Carlos Rodriguez (http://s8f.org/)\n- Copyright (C) 2012 Terra Eclipse, Inc.
